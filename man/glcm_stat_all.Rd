\title{Aggregates GLCM-based statistics based-on supplied function}
\usage{
glcm_stat_all(RIA_data_in, statistic = "mean(X, na.rm = TRUE)",
  verbose_in = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{RIA_data_in}{\emph{RIA_image}, created by \code{\link[RIA]{load_dicom}}.}

\item{statistic}{string, defining the statistic to be calculated on the array of GLCM statistics.
By default, statistic is set to \emph{"mean"}, however any function may be provided. The proper
syntax is: function(X, attributes). The supplied string must contain a "X", which will be replaced
with the array of the GLCM statistics value. Further attributes of the function may also be given.
For example, if you wish to calculate the median of all GLCMs calculated in different directions,
then it must be supplied as: \emph{median(X, na.rm = TRUE)}.}

\item{verbose_in}{logical, indicating whether to print detailed information.
Most prints can also be suppressed using the \code{\link{suppressMessages}} function.}
}
\value{
\emph{RIA_image} containing the statistical information.
}
\description{
Calculates aggregated statistics of GLCM matrix statistics calculated on
GCLM matrices evaluated in all different directions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
#Discretize loaded image and then calculate GLCM statistics for all matrices
RIA_image <- discretize(RIA_image, bins_in = c(4, 8), equal_prob = TRUE,
use_orig = TRUE, write_orig = FALSE)
RIA_image <- glcm_all(RIA_image, use_type = "discretized", distance = c(1:2))
RIA_image <- glcm_stat(RIA_image)

#Calculate the average of the different GLCM matrices in the different directions
RIA_image <- glcm_stat_all(RIA_image)
}
