\title{Calculates all radiomic statistics on supplied RIA_image}
\usage{
radiomics_all(RIA_data_in, bins_in = c(2, 8, 32, 128), equal_prob = FALSE,
  fo_discretized = FALSE, distance = c(1, 2, 3),
  statistic = "mean(X, na.rm = TRUE)", geometry_discretized = FALSE,
  verbose_in = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{RIA_data_in}{\emph{RIA_image}, created by \code{\link[RIA]{load_dicom}}.}

\item{bins_in}{integer vector, number of bins specified.}

\item{equal_prob}{logical, indicating to cut data into bins with equal relative frequencies.
If FALSE, then equal interval bins will be used.}

\item{fo_discretized}{logical, indicating whether to calculate first-order statistics on 
discretized images.}

\item{distance}{integer, distance between the voxels being compared.}

\item{statistic}{string, defining the statistic to be calculated on the array of GLCM statistics.
By default, statistic is set to \emph{"mean"}, however any function may be provided. The proper
syntax is: function(X, attributes). The supplied string must contain a "X", which will be replaced
with the array of the GLCM statistics value. Further attributes of the function may also be given.
For example, if you wish to calculate the median of all GLCMs calculated in different directions,
then it must be supplied as: \emph{median(X, na.rm = TRUE)}.}

\item{geometry_discretized}{logical, indicating whether to calculate geometry-based statistics on 
discretized images.}

\item{verbose_in}{logical, indicating whether to print detailed information.
Most prints can also be suppressed using the \code{\link{suppressMessages}} function.}
}
\value{
\emph{RIA_image} containing the statistical information.
}
\description{
Calculates specified radiomic statistics on \emph{RIA_image}. Parameters of
radiomic functions may be set. By default the the images are discretized to 2, 8, 32 and 128 bins
using equally sized binning. First-order statistics are calculated on the
original image and if asked then on all discretizations. Symmetric GLCMs are calculated for all directions
at a distance of 1, 2 and 3 for all discretizations. GLRLMs are also calculated for all
discretizations. Geometry-based statistics are calculated for the original image as well as all
discretizations is requested.

#Discretize loaded image and then calculate all radiomic statistics

RIA_image <- radiomics_all(RIA_image, equal_prob = TRUE, bins_in= c(2,8,32,128), distance = c(1:3))
