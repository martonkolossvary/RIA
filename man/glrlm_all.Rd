\usage{
glrlm_all(RIA_data_in, use_type = "discretized", use_orig = FALSE,
  use_slot = NULL, save_name = NULL, verbose_in = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{RIA_data_in}{\emph{RIA_image}, created by \code{\link[RIA]{load_dicom}}.}

\item{use_type}{string, can be \emph{"single"} which runs the function on a single image,
which is determined using \emph{"use_orig"} or \emph{"use_slot"}. \emph{"discretized"}
takes all datasets in the \emph{RIA_image$discretized} slot and runs the analysis on them.}

\item{use_orig}{logical, indicating to use image present in \emph{RIA_data$orig}.
If FALSE, the modified image will be used stored in \emph{RIA_data$modif}.}

\item{use_slot}{string, name of slot where data wished to be used is. Use if the desired image
is not in the \emph{data$orig} or \emph{data$modif} slot of the \emph{RIA_image}. For example,
if the desired dataset is in \emph{RIA_image$discretized$ep_4}, then \emph{use_slot} should be
\emph{discretized$ep_4}. The results are automatically saved. If the results are not saved to
the desired slot, then please use \emph{save_name} parameter.}

\item{save_name}{string, indicating the name of subslot of \emph{$glcm} to save results to.
If left empty, then it will be automatically determined by RIA.}

\item{verbose_in}{logical indicating whether to print detailed information.
Most prints can also be suppressed using the \code{\link{suppressMessages}} function.}

\value{
\emph{RIA_image} containing the GLRLMs.

\description{
Creates gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM) from \emph{RIA_image}.
GLRLM assesses the spatial relation of voxels to each other by investigating how many times
same value voxels occur next to each other in a given direction. While the \code{\link[RIA]{glrlm}}
function calculates the GLRLM in one given direction, the \code{\link[RIA]{glrlm_all}} function
simultaneously calculates all GLRLMs in all possible directions. 
For 3D datasets, this means GLCMs will be calculated for all 13 different directions.
In case of 2D datasets, only 4 are returned by default.
By default the \emph{use_type} is set to \emph{discretize}, therefore GLRLMs will be calculated
for all discretized images in all directions. Also \emph{single} data processing is supported, 
then by default the image in the \emph{$modif} slot will be used. If \emph{use_slot} is given,
then the data present in \emph{RIA_image$use_slot} will be used for calculations.
Results will be saved into the \emph{glrlm} slot. The name of the subslot is automatically
generated by RIA.

#Discretize loaded image and then calculate GLRLM matrix of RIA_image$modif
RIA_image <- discretize(RIA_image, bins_in = c(4, 8), equal_prob = TRUE,
use_orig = TRUE, write_orig = FALSE)
RIA_image <- glrlm_all(RIA_image, use_type = "single")

#Use use_slot parameter to set which image to use
RIA_image <- glrlm_all(RIA_image, use_type = "single", use_orig = FALSE, use_slot = "discretized$ep_4")

#Batch calculation of GLCM matrices on all disretized images
