# Radiomics Image Analysis (RIA)

Radiomics Image Analysis (RIA) package was developed to facilitate radiomic analysis of medical images. `RIA` can calculate hundreds of different statistics on both 2D and 3D images. `RIA` supports analysis of `DICOM`, `NIfTI` and `nrrd` images. Almost all calculations are vectorized and therefore are super-efficient. The package is developed by Márton Kolossváry a medical doctor not an engineer, therefore all functionalities of the software package are developed in a way that can be learnt by non-professionals. `RIA` is constantly updated with new functionalities and wrap-around functions to make the calculation of radiomic metrics even simpler.

# Its as easy as 1, 2, 3

RIA allows users to take control of each and every aspect of radiomic analysis using specific functions. However, for most users 3 lines of simple code: one loading the data and one calculating the statistics, and one exporting the results is enough:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Load the data by providing the location of the DICOM, NIfTI or nrrd file(s)
DICOM <- load_dicom(filename = "C:/Image/")

#Calculate first-order, GLCM, GLRLM and geometry based statistics
DICOM <- radiomics_all(DICOM, equal_prob = "both")

#Save output to csv
save_RIA(DICOM, save_to = "C:/Test/", save_name = "My_first_radiomics", group_name = "Case")
```
These three simple lines of code result in thousands of radiomic parameters calculated for the given image! For a more detailed introduction to RIA please read the [vignette](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RIA/vignettes/RIA.html).
If you wish to better understand Radiomics I would suggest reading ["Cardiac Computed Tomography Radiomics: A Comprehensive Review on Radiomic Techniques"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28346329/) and ["Radiomic Features Are Superior to Conventional Quantitative Computed Tomographic Metrics to Identify Coronary Plaques With Napkin-Ring Sign"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29233836/) which describes the calculation and each statistic in detail in the supplementary files.
